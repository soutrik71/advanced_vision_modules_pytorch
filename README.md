# Custom PyTorch Models for CIFAR-10 Dataset

## Overview

This repository contains custom PyTorch models developed for the CIFAR-10 dataset. These models are implemented from scratch in PyTorch, both custom models and those inspired by existing research papers.

## Content

- **src**: This directory contains the source code for custom PyTorch models.
- **out_of_the_papers_models**: Here reside models inspired by existing research papers.
  
## Achievements

- **Training Accuracy**: Achieved over 90% accuracy on the training set.
- **Validation Accuracy**: Achieved close to 88% accuracy on the validation set.

## Models

The models included in this repository are handcrafted from scratch in PyTorch, with a focus on performance and efficiency. We have implemented various architectures tailored specifically for the CIFAR-10 dataset to achieve high accuracy rates.

## Usage

To utilize these models, simply import them into your PyTorch project. We recommend referring to the individual model files for documentation and usage instructions.
