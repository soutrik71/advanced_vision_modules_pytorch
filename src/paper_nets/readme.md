# Advanced Vision Modules in PyTorch

This repository contains the implementation of advanced vision models from scratch using PyTorch.

## Models Implemented

- **ResNet Model**: The ResNet model, or Residual Network, is a classic neural network used as a backbone for many computer vision tasks. This model is known for its ability to alleviate the vanishing gradient problem during training by introducing "shortcut connections."

- **Inception Model**: The Inception model, or GoogLeNet, is a convolutional neural network that was proposed to deal with the problem of large computational cost of large convolutional neural networks. It introduces the concept of "Inception module" which significantly reduces the number of parameters in the network.

- **VGG Model**: The VGG model, or Visual Geometry Group, is a convolutional neural network known for its simplicity and the fact that it has only 3x3 convolutional layers stacked on top of each other in increasing depth.

## Other Models

We are continuously working to add more models to this repository. Stay tuned!

## Usage

To use these models, simply import the desired model from the `models` directory and use it in your PyTorch pipeline.

## Contribution

Contributions to this repository are always welcome. You can either propose a new model or improvements to the existing models.
